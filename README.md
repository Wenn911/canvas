# Canvas

This a solution for НПО "Фарватер" Frontend developer vacancy from career.habr.com. So, I'll be happy if I join your team.

### I managed to implement:

1. Adding an element
2. Connection between elements
3. Storing state in localstorage
4. Moving elements on the canvas

Unfortunately, I was not able to add a change in the number of sockets and save the state correctly. I will be glad to receive feedback with an explanation of errors.

Using React and React Konva

Anyway, I am grateful for the experience gained on this task.

## Usage

To add an element, click on the text.

To delete an element, right-click on the element.

To clear the canvas, double-click on an empty space and press F5
